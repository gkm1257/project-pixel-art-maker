## Instructions

To create a `Design Canvas`, input the `Grid Height` and `Grid Width` between 1 to 50 then click `Submit`.

By clicking on the cell, you can toggle the background color of the cell between to the color you picked or the initial color `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)`.

If you want to clear the whole `Design Canvas`, just click `Submit` again with the same `Grid Height` and `Grid Width`.
